## Our Mission
The goal of this application is to address feelings of anxiety that have arisen amongst University of Washington: Seattle campus students with a recent uptake in violent crime occurring around the UW neighborhood, particularly after dark. Through our application, we hope to empower students to make safer commuting choices while traversing through the UW neighborhood by allowing them to share and access timely safety-related information.

This application addresses UN SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. According to the UN website, this SDG promotes “making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable,” ultimately aligning with our group’s goal of increasing safety for UW students in the University District neighborhood. 

## About Make it Home
Make it Home is a web-based solution to help UW students stay informed about non-life threatening incidents near and around the UW campus during nighttime. We are providing a structured forum for students to provide real-time updates and provide resources to make safe commuting decisions.
