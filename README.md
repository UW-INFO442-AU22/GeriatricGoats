# Make it Home üåô
Make it Home is a web-based solution to help University of Washington students stay informed about non-life threatening incidents near and around campus during nighttime. We are providing a structured forum for students to provide real-time updates and provide resources to make safe commuting decisions.

## Our Mission
The goal of Make it Home is to address feelings of anxiety that have risen amongst University of Washington: Seattle campus students with a recent uptake in violent crime occurring around the UW neighborhood, particularly after dark. Through our application, we hope to empower students to make safer commuting choices while traversing through the UW neighborhood by allowing them to share and access timely safety-related information.

With the aim of increasing safety for UW students in the University District neighborhood, Make it Home also aligns with the eleventh United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG): Sustainable Cities and Communities. This entails ‚Äúmaking cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable‚Äù [1].
